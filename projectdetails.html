    <p><strong>Smart Craddle using IOT</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Developed a smart craddle using IOT.</li>
        <li> This system can detect the emotions of the baby cry or laugh.</li>
        <li> With the help of IOT , from any where in the world we can control the cradle.</li>
        <li> Captured images will be sent to the parents directly over IOT server.</li>
        <li> Toy and fan can be controlled.</li>
        <li> Temperature and humidity can be measured and can be monitored over IOT.</li>
        <li> Cradle can be oscillated with the help of Blynk App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Vehicle Speed Detection and Automatic Challan Generation</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><label> Around the world main cause of the motor vehicle accident are over speeding. Despite of many </label>
            <label>traffic rules like
            speed zone, stopping at traffic light etc. people simply avoid them.</label></li>
        <li><label>we proposed an Automatic speed control method to reduce the speed of the vehicle in given zone.</label>
            <label> The speed of the vehicle will not increase above given limit. in this method we are using RF </label>
            <label>module and IR sensor to detect overspeeding and thus it will reduce the speed to a given limit.</label></li>
        <li><label>We are also proposing an Automatic challan system with the help of GSM module. If driver will </label>
            <label>over speed after warning, a massage will be sent to drivers registered number and nearest police </label>
            <label>station that vehicle has crossed the speed limit and automatic challan will be generated.</label></li>
    </ul>
